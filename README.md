## Getting StartedüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (for creating virtual environments)


### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YaChunT/PictaGram.git
```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd "Social Book"
    cd social_book
    ```

3. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    - Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows:
            ```bash
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
4. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set Up the Database**

    Apply migrations to set up the database schema:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
6. **Create a Superuser**

    Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create your admin user with your own chosen username and password.

7. **(Optional) Collect Static Files**

    This step is typically necessary for production environments, but you can also run it during development to test the static file collection process:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py collectstatic
    ```

8. **Run the Development Server**

    Start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

    Your application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Running Tests

To run tests for the application, use the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
